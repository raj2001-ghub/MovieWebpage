# MovieWebpage
 This is a website which uses Django in the backend and HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT in the Front End . This webpage manages a database of its own which consists of storing ratings , movie names ,genres and the overall summary of that movie . After that we can visualise the movies as we want genrewise .We can also search for movies we want to know about . We can even add our knowledge into the database if we have any film in our mind. This site gives the user complete freedom to be a critic in their own rights . They can give ratings to movies based on how they liked it and they can write the summary for those films too togetehr.
